                            CLAUSES TASK
                     ===========================


GROUP BY:- Group by clause is used to divide similar data items
=========  into set of logical groups.and also group by clause    
           reduces no of rows in each group.

Syntax: select columnname.......
        from tablename 
        group by columnname;

Execution order:-
==============
1.FROM 
2.WHERE
3.GROUP BY 
4.HAVING
5.SELECT
6.DISTINCT
7.ORDER BY
8.OFFSET
9.FETCH


RULE:- Other than group function columns specified after select
=====  then those all columns must be specified after group by.
       Otherwise oracle server returns an error not a GROUP BY 
       expression.

Note:- In all database systems we can also use group by clauses
=====   without using group functions.

EG:-select deptno from emp
==    group by deptno;

    SQL>select deptno from emp
        group by deptno;

        DEPTNO
      ----------
          30
          10
          20

step1:-group by deptno;

deptno                                                Result set table    
------                                                ----------------
10                         10 it reduces into '1' 10          deptno
20                         10--------------------->    10      10                                       
30                         10
10 similar data items into 20 it reduces into '1' 20
20  set of logical groups  20---------------------->   20      20
30-----------------------> 20
10                         30 it reduces into '1' 30
20                         30 ---------------------->  30      30
30                         30

step2:-select deptno from....
=====          | 
               |-------->this deptno is selected from result set table
                         not from the original table.


        DEPTNO
      ----------
          30
          10
          20

individual group functions means there is no problem
---------------------------------------------------
SQL>select sum(Sal) from emp;

    SUM(SAL)
   ----------         
     46425

individual group functions there is no problem.

  
 SQL>select deptno,sum(Sal) from emp;//it won't work
             ||          ||
             ||          ||
normal column means     group function means always
record by record         all values at a time executed. 
    executed       

         synchronization is not there
                   ||
                   ||Solution is
                   ||
           we must use group by

error:not agroup by expression

solution:-
=========
SQL>select deptno,sum(sal) 
        from emp 
     group by deptno;
       ||
     it takes other than group function column.


    

HAVING Clause:- In all relational databses after group by clause we 
==============  are not allowed to use where clause. In place of this
               one ansi/iso SQL provided another clause having.
               
generally where clause is used to restrict the rows in a table.
where as having clause is used to
restricting the groups after group by.

in where clause we are not allowed to use group functions 
where as in having clause we can also use group functions.


Q) Write a query to display no of persons in each state 
        from following Person table(2marks)
-->simply i want state wise count
