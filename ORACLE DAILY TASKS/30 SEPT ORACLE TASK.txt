                        Sub Querys Task
                    ========================

                             SUB QUERYS 
                        ===================

    Query within another query is called as
 Sub query or Nested query.Sub querys are used to retrieve 
 data from single or multiple tables by using
 more than one step process. 


    All relational databases having two types of sub querys.
    These are

   1. Non- Correlated sub querys
   2. Correlated sub querys

  In Non-correlated sub querys child query is executed first then
only parent query is executed, whereas in correlated sub querys 
parent query is executed first then only child query is executed.

1. Non-Correlated sub querys:-
==============================
Non Corelated sub querys having two parts.
1)Child query
2)Parent query

1. Child Query:- A query which provides values to the another query
==============   is called Child Query or Inner Query.

2. Parent Query:- A query which receiving values from another query 
=================    is called Parent Query or Outer Query.

.In non-correlated sub query maximum limit is up to 255 querys.

NON-CORRELATED SUB QUERY:-
=========================
        |
        |----------->1)single row sub querys
        |----------->2)multiple row sub querys
        |----------->3)multiple column sub querys
        |----------->4)inline views (or)subquery are used in from
                       clause.

1)single row sub querys
=======================
   This is a single row sub query because here child query
returns single value. In single row sub query's we are
using =,<,>,<=,>=, between operators.

RULES:-
=======
1)90%    --------->same column
2)5%     --------->group function
3)3%     --------->expressions
4)2%     --------->different column


select * from emp where condition=(select ............)
      
EG:-
===
SQL> select max(sal) from emp where sal<(select max(sal) from emp);

        Display mechanism in              Task in right hand
         left hand side                        side

6.Write a query to display second highest sal employee 
            details from emp table?

SECOND MAXIMUM SALARY EMP DETAILS  ====> SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL = (SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE SAL< (SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP));

       more salary than the avg(sal)from emp?

SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL > (SELECT AVG(SAL) FROM EMP);



8.Write a query to display the employee records who are 
        earning more salary than the BLAKE salary?

SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL > (SELECT SAL FROM EMP WHERE ENAME = 'BLAKE');



9.Write a query to display the employee records whose job 
            title is same as ALLEN?

10.Find the employee name who is earning maximum salary?


SQL> SELECT ENAME FROM EMP WHERE SAL = (SELECT MAX(sAL) FROM EMP);

              their employees?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ADVANCED QUErys
================
Group by clause used in single row subquery:-in all relational data
-------------------------------------------   bases we can also use
group by clause in parent query.


NOTE:-In all  relational databases whenever child query having nested
=====  group functions then we must use Group BY clause within child
       query.otherwise database server returns error.

 *
***write a query to display highest no of employee department
 *   from emp table by using group by clause?


Write a query to display those jobs avg(sal) is  more than the 
the clerks job avg(sal) from emp table by using group by?


*
* Write a query to display lowest average salary job from emp tables?
* 


Write a query to display the employees who are working in sales 
   department from emp,dept tables.

NOTE:-in all relational databases whenever we are using 
===== non-corelated subqueries always database server returns
      parent query table columns in final output.to overcome
problem if we want to use child query table columns in parent
query or if we want to display child query table columns in final
output then we must use joins with in parent query.

SQL>select ename,dname
     from emp e,dept d
    where e.deptno=d.deptno
    and d.deptno=(select deptno from dept where dname='SALES');

    ENAME           DNAME
  ---------       ---------
    ALLEN           SALES
    WARD            SALES
    MARTIN          SALES
    BLAKE           SALES
    TURNER          SALES
    JAMES           SALES 


----------------------------------------------------------------------
2)MULTIPLE ROW SUB QUERYS:-
=========================

Write a query to display employee details who are getting 
maximum sal in each department from emp table.

SQL>select * from emp
    where sal=(select max(sal) from emp group by deptno);
                       2850
                       3000
                       5000

error:single row subquery returns more than one row.
  
   When child query returns multiple values then those querys are
called Multiple row Sub Querys.in multiple row subquery we are
using in,all,any operators. 


1.Write a query to display employee details who are getting 
      maximum sal in each department from emp table.

SQL> SELECT ENAME,DEPTNO,SAL FROM EMP E
  2  WHERE SAL = (SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO = E.DEPTNO);




2.Write a query to display the employees who are working in sales
   or research department from emp,dept?

SQL> SELECT E.ENAME,E.DEPTNO,D.DNAME FROM EMP E INNER JOIN DEPT D
  2  ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO AND D.DNAME IN ('SALES','RESEARCH');




3.Display the male employees who are getting more
   salary than the all the salaries of female employees?(5marks)

SQL> select * from employee;

         5      kavya           f           2000

SQL> SELECT * FROM EMP1 WHERE SAL > ALL(SELECT SAL FROM EMP1 WHERE GENDER = 'F') AND GENDER='M';



4.display the employee records whose job title is 
            same as SMITH,BLAKE
