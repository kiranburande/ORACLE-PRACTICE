                       =====================

                           CONSTRAINTS
                     =======================

                        Data integrity(To maintaine proper data)or
                           /      \    (To maintaine valid data)
                          /        \
                        SQL       Triggers
                    CONSTRAINTS

Constraints are used to prevents or stops invalid data entry into 
our tables. Generally constraints are created on table columns. 
Oracle server having following types of constraints.These are

1. Not null
2. Unique
3. Primary key
4. Foreign key
5. Check
  
   in database if we want to maintain proper data or valid data 
according to client requirement then we are using sql language
constraints,procedure language trigger.


1)NOT NULL:- in all relational databases not null constraint doesn't
===========   support table level. This constraint doesn't accepts
               null values. But it will accepts duplicate values.


2.UNIQUE:-This constraint is created on column level, table level.
========  This constraint doesn't accepts duplicate values. But 
          it will accepts null values.

3.Primary Key:- Primary key Uniquely identifying a record in a 
=============   table. There can be only one primary key in a table 
and also primary key doesn't accepts duplicate null values. 


4.Foreign Key:-in all relational databases If we want to establishes
=============  relationship between tables then we are using 
               Referential Integrity Constraint Foreign Key.

  generally One table foreign key must belongs to another table
primary key.and also primary key,foreign key columns must belong
to same data types.

  Always foreign key values based on primary key values only.
Generally, primary key doesn't accepts duplicate, null, values 
where as foreign key accepts duplicate, null values.

5)CHECK:-check constraint is used to define logical conditions
========  according to business rules.


1.create the student table with constraints based on following
  conditions

SID     Don't accept nulls and duplicates

SNAME   Don't accept nulls

M1      Marks between 0 to 100


SQL> CREATE TABLE STUDENT10
  2  (SID  NUMBER(3) PRIMARY KEY,
  3   SNAME VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL,
  4   M1 NUMBER(3) CHECK (M1 <= 100 AND M1 >= 0));



2.create the employee table with constraints based on following
  conditions

USERID     don't accept nulls and duplicates

USERNAME   don't accept nulls and duplicates

PWD         Password minimum 8 characters


SQL> CREATE TABLE EMP11
  2  (USERID  NUMBER(3),
  3   USERNAME VARCHAR2(20),
  4   PWD  VARCHAR2(20) CHECK(LENGTH(PWD)>=8),
  5   PRIMARY KEY(USERID,USERNAME));



3.create the emp table with constraints based on following
  conditions

EMPNO      don't accept nulls and duplicates

ENAME      don't accept nulls

GENDER     Must be M or F

SAL        Minimum 5000 (means 5000 or above it will accept)

SQL> CREATE TABLE EMP12
  2  (EMPNO NUMBER(3) PRIMARY KEY,
  3   ENAME VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL,
  4   GENDER CHAR(1) CHECK(GENDER IN('M','F')),
  5   SAL  NUMBER(5) CHECK(SAL >= 5000));




Default
=======
.it is used to apply default value to column
.if we pass the value,it takes that value.if we dont pass the value
 it takes default value.

4.Create the table with 3 columns and apply default clause on fee

NAME     SAL(DEFAULT 5000)

SQL> CREATE TABLE EMP13
  2  (NAME  VARCHAR2(10),
  3   SAL NUMBER(5)  DEFAULT 5000 );



5.Establish the relation b/w course and student table by using
  Primary key,Forign key

COURSE                         STUDENT
=======                        ========
PK                                              FK
CID    CNAME                  SID     SNAME     CID





6.create the emp table with following columns.and you only think which 
  constraint is suitable at table creation it self.
  use all constraints

EMPNO     ENAME     SAL     MGRNO     AGE     ADDRESS    PHONO


Adding (or) Dropping constraints on existing table:-
==================================================
      In all relational databases by using alter command we
can also add or drop constraints on existing table.

NOTE 1:- If we want to add constraints on existing table 
          existing column then we are using  
            table level syntax method.

Eg:-
===
SQL> alter table a1 add primary key(sno);

NOTE 2: If we want to add a new column along with 
         constraint then we are using 
          Column level syntax method.

Eg:-
===
SQL> alter table a1 add name varchar2(10) unique;

Adding foreign key to existing table
====================================
SQL>alter table a2 add foreign key(sno) references a1(sno)
       on delete cascade;


NOTE 3:-in oracle If we want to add NOT NULL constraint on
======   existing table existing column then we are using 
        alter with modify by using following syntax.

Syntax:-
=======
SQL>alter table tablename modify columnname not null; 
Eg:-
=== 
SQL> create table a3(sno number(10));
SQL> alter table a3 modify sno not null;
SQL>desc a3;
 *
***Copying table and copying records
 * =================================
.copying a table means,creating new table from existing table

.for copying table we use create command

.new table will created with select query result.
 
NOTE:- In al relational databases whenever we are copying a
=====  table from another table all constraints are never
       copied except not null constraint.

Eg:-
===
SQL> create table dept1
     as
     select * from dept;

 *
***copying table structure
 *


Q)create new table with name emp2 from existing table emp

create table tablename
  as
select stmt
from tablename
where false condition;

eg of false condition

1=2
'A'='B'

Q)create a table with the name emp3 from existing table emp without
  rows(copying table structure)
